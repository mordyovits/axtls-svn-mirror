axhttpd is a small embedded web server using the axTLS library.

It is based originally on the web server written by Doug Currie which is at:

Basic Authentication
====================

Basic Authentication uses a password file called  ".htpasswd", in the 
directory to be  protected. This file is formatted as the familiar 
colon-separated username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited by 
newlines. The protection does not carry over to subdirectories. The 
utility program htpasswd is included to help manually edit .htpasswd files.

The encryption of this password uses a proprietary algorithm due to the 
dependency of many crypt libraries on DES.

An example is in /test_dir/ssl_only (username 'abcd', password is '1234').

Note: This is an mconf configuration option.

SSL Protection
====================

Directories/files can be accessed using the 'http' or 'https' uri prefix. If
normal http access for a directory needs to be disabled, then put
"SSLRequireSSL" into a '.htaccess' file in the directory to be protected.

Conversely, use "SSLDenySSL" to deny access to directories via SSL.

An example is in /test_dir/ssl_only and /test_dir/no_ssl.

Entire directories can be denied access with a "Deny all" directive
(regardless of SSL or authentication).

CGI
===

chroot() is now used for added security. However this has the impact of
removing the regular filesystem, so any CGI applications no longer have the 
usual access (to things like /bin, /lib etc).

So any executables and libraries need to be copied into webroot.

Failure to do so will result in mystical blank screens (and probably hundreds
of axhttpd instances being created...).

Directory Listing
=================

An mconf option. Allow the files in directories to be displayed.

Permissions Checking
=====================

An mconf option. This will display the various file permissions to standard
output of files in web root.

Other Features
==============

Check the help options in mconf for all the other features used.
